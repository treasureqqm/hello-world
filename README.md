# hello-world
My first attempt on github
just-a-new-branch
刚才那个弄错了。没有在readme-edits.md里面，而直接写在master里面了。

I have started my coding life since July 4, 2016.
I didn't meet my own expect at all up to now.
I want to be a powerful and professional man.
I will work hard always.
Wish me a better me.
master
